# Learning-Machines
Every week this Site will be updated with Readings of a particular CS and ML algorithms, mainly focussing on Dynamic Programming and/or Un/Supervised learning.
The algorithms get tougher with every passing week. At some point later next year, we delve into Probabilistic Inference, Deep learning, etc

I will provide Links to Datasets, Reading material and at the end of that we should upload a program implementing said algorithm/s in the language of our choosing. (C/C++, R, Python, Java, JS (maybe))

You must have : Elements of Statistical Learning 
I will provide tons of sites to read and check out. You can also do the same if you come across something useful.


Week 1: Since it is the first week and since I'm traveling :P, we'll start easy

Machine Learning:
Intro to ML 
https://blog.monkeylearn.com/a-gentle-guide-to-machine-learning/
http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/

10 ML terms explained
http://blog.aylien.com/10-machine-learning-terms-explained-in-simple/

In-depth Guide.

The above link explains really well what Ml curtails from Model Selection, Data Preparation, Model Performance, etc.

Algorithms:
Searching and Sorting:
Read up on all sorting and searching algorithms

# Ex 1: (would be better if implemented in C/C++, Java, JS)
Implement Insertion, Selection, Quick and Merge sort in your favorite language.
The program should be such that it should run from the command window 
I/P: Sequence of Numbers
O/P: Sorted sequence of Numbers

Understand the basic difference between each
Uploading to Git: ex1_name.py


# Ex 2: (would be better if implemented in C/C++, Java, JS)
Implement Searching Algorithms: Sequential Search and Binary Search
User should provide number/name to be searched
Output: Position of the string or number 

Understand the basic difference between each
Uploading to Git: ex2_name.py
